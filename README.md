# ToDo List App

## Introduction

The Todo List application is a single-page web application developed with Nuxt.js, a Vue.js framework for building modern web applications. It utilizes the Vuetify UI library for a clean and responsive user interface. The app follows a client-side architecture and stores data locally using the browser's LocalStorage.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the ToDo List App locally on your development machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Node.js:** Make sure you have a version that is compatible with Nuxt.js (v12 or higher is recommended).

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dthrllnrs/todo-list.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd todo-list
```
Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Run the application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the ToDo List App using the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
This will start a development server, and you can access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
